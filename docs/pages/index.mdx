# Feedback

**Feedback** is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) based feedback widget and dashboard.

## Usage on React App

We have an npm package that exposes our feedback form as a React component. To use it, first install the package:

```
yarn add @fossil-cloud/feedback
```

Then import the component in your React app and wrap whatever button you want to trigger the widget with it. 
Pass the email of the currently authenticated user to the `user` prop:

```tsx
// ...
import { Feedback } from '@fossil-cloud/feedback';

const App = () => {
    
  return (
    <Layout>
      <Feedback user={currentUser.email} />
    </Layout>
  );
}
```
